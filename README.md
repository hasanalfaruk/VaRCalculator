# VaRCalculator

Please run Main.Java and follow the console prompts to use the Calculator.

Note: I Found that towards the end of the time limit my calculations were infact slightly off. I only noticed this once a few of my tests failed. As such the main objective of the task may not have been met. However I have seen the areas where I tripped up - a better implementation of TDD would have ironed out this issue at the very start and I hope to take this lesson moving forward in my projects. 

The main bulk of the program works, so I hope this has displayed a few of my general programming skills.
